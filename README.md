# Network Infrastructure

### Overview
This repository documents my **homelab network setup**, highlighting my expertise in **network administration, security, and monitoring**. The setup includes:
- **Cisco Router & Switch:** Core network infrastructure with VLANs, DHCP, and ACLs.
- **Proxmox Virtualization Server:** Hosting various VMs for Windows Server, Splunk, Zabbix, and testing environments such as Cisco Modeling Labs.
- **Wi-Fi Access Point** Providing secure wireless access.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Implemented **Zabbix for SNMP monitoring** and **Splunk for Syslog analysis**.
- **VPN Configuration:** Remote access to Servers and Clients via **Tailscale** .

### **VLAN Configuration/ Subnet Plan**
| VLAN Name         | Subnet                | Purpose                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Native VLAN       | Subnet 1 /24 Mask     | General Network                       |
| Servers           | Subnet 2 /28 Mask     | Windows Server, Zabbix, Splunk        |
| Clients           | Subnet 3 /24 Mask     | Windows/Linux Workstations            |
| Access Point      | Subnet 4 /24 Mask     | Wi-Fi                                 |
| Management        | Subnet 5 /30 Mask     | Network Admin                         |

### Firewall / ACL Confiuration
- Access Group Configured to translate IP address via PAT (NAT Overload) on homelab network to access Internet via the ISP Router.
- Blocked Specific Servers access to the internet
- Denied SSH & RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) access from Client VLAN to Servers VLAN.
- Allowed only specific hosts access to Management VLAN
- Blocked Access Point VLAN from accessing the Management & Server VLANs except for my Admin Laptop
- Example:

`ip access-list extended AP_TO_SERVER`

`remark Block Access Point VLAN from Accessing Server VLAN except for Admin Laptop`

`permit ip host X.X.X.X X.X.X.0 0.0.0.240   ! Allow My Admin PC to access Server VLAN`

`deny ip X.X.X.0 0.0.0.255 X.X.X.0 0.0.0.240  ! Block other Access Point PCs`

`permit ip any any                                ! Allow other traffic`

## **Future Plans**
- Introduce **Firewall** Technologies such **Fortigate** or **PFsense** into infrastrucutre extra layer of security.
- Implement site to site VPN to an Oracle Cloud VM via **Cisco IPSec Tunnel** for network access control
- Expand Splunk dashboards for **threat detection**.
- Learn **Python** and set up an Ansible Playbook for Network Automation.
- Implement AI-driven network management systems (ex. ML for anomaly detection, predicting network issues, or detect zero-day attacks)
- Test & Practice BGP configuration, route optimization, and policy management, to effectively manage network traffic in service provider environments.

# Network Infrastructure

### Overview
This repository documents my **homelab network setup**, highlighting my expertise in **network administration, security, and monitoring**. The setup includes:
- **Cisco Router & Switch:** Core network infrastructure with VLANs, DHCP, and ACLs.
- **Proxmox Virtualization Server:** Hosting various VMs for Windows Server, Splunk, Zabbix, and testing environments.
- **Wi-Fi Access Point** Providing secure wireless access.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Implemented **Zabbix for SNMP monitoring** and **Splunk for log analysis**.
- **VPN Configuration:** Remote access to Servers and Clients via **Tailscale** .

### Skills Learned

- Understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Creating Network Toplogies/Diagram
- Linux Installation & Administration
- Wireless Network â€“ Configured AP for seamless Wi-Fi access with VLAN segmentation.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Installing and configuring Zabbix Server and Agents.
- SNMP-based monitoring for network devices

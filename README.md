# NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW

### Overview
Designed, deployed, and maintained a scalable LAN network for multiple devices/users to simulate an enterprise network using a variety of network devices such as a Cisco router, Cisco switch, Access Point and a Proxmox virtualization server. Configured inter-VLAN routing with ROAS. Implemented VLAN segmentation, and optimized Layer 2/3 switching for security and performance such as SNMPv3 for secure enterprise-leve network monitoring. ACL/firewall rules to restrict and permit access. Setup VPN & Remote Access for secure remote administration.

# Homelab Network Infrastructure

## Overview
This repository documents my **homelab network setup**, highlighting my expertise in **network administration, security, and monitoring**. The setup includes:
- **Cisco Router & Switch:** Core network infrastructure with VLANs, DHCP, ACLs, and VPN.
- **Proxmox Virtualization Server:** Hosting various VMs for Windows Server, Splunk, Zabbix, and testing environments.
- **Wi-Fi Access Point** Providing secure wireless access.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Implemented **Zabbix for SNMP monitoring** and **Splunk for log analysis**.
- **VPN Configuration:** Remote access via **Cisco VPN**.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- SPLUNK - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- ZABBIX - 
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
- Tailscale - Remote Access via VPN
